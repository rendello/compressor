Integers are little endian.

VALUE:      [52 5A] 2*U8
PURPOSE:    Signature. "RZ" (Rendello Zip).

VALUE:      U8
PURPOSE:    <bc_count> Count of bit count values.

VALUE:      U8*bc_count
PURPOSE:    Each integer encodes the number of bytes that have a given bit
            count. The bit count itself is determined by the int's position,
            ie. if the second ints has a decimal value of 3, then there are
            three bytes that have a bit length of two. <byte_count> is the sum
            of these ints.

VALUE:      U8*byte_count
PURPOSE:    The bytes present in the file, ordered first by bit count and then
            by numerical value.

VALUE:      U3
PURPOSE:    End-padding, 0 to 7 bits to ignore at the end of the file. Necessary
            as compressed text may not be byte-aligned.

VALUE:      (variable)
PURPOSE:    Compressed text.
